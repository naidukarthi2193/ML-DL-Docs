# Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is defined as the use algorithms and computational statistics to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subsection of the artificial intelligence domain within computer science. Machine learning’s rise to prominence today has been enabled by the abundance of data, more efficient data storage, and faster computers.

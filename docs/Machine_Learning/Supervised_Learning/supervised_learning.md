# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is a type of system in which both input and desired output data are provided. Input and output data are labelled for classification to provide a learning basis for future data processing. The term supervised learning comes from the idea that an algorithm is learning from a training dataset, which can be thought of as the teacher.


Supervised machine learning systems provide the learning algorithms with known quantities to support future judgments. Chatbots, self-driving cars, facial recognition programs, expert systems and robots are among the systems that may use either supervised or unsupervised learning. Supervised learning systems are mostly associated with retrieval-based AI but they may also be capable of using a generative learning model.

### Working
In general, supervised learning occurs when a system is given input and output variables with the intentions of learning how they are mapped together, or related. The goal is to produce an accurate enough mapping function that when new input is given, the algorithm can predict the output. This is an iterative process, and each time the algorithm makes a prediction, it is corrected or given feedback until it achieves an acceptable level of performance.

Training data for supervised learning includes a set of examples with paired input subjects and desired output (which is also referred to as the supervisory signal). For example, in an application of supervised learning for image processing, an AI system might be provided with labeled pictures of vehicles in categories such as cars or trucks. After a sufficient amount of observation, the system should be able to distinguish between and categorize unlabeled images, at which time the training is complete.

Applications of supervised learning are typically broken down into two categories, classification and regression. Classification is similar to the example above, when the output value is a category such as car or truck and true or false. A regression problem is when the output is a real, computed value such as the price or weight.
